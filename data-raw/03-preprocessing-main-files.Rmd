# Introduction

This Rmarkdown file is part of the
[**ActiveCA**](https://github.com/dias-bruno/ActiveCA) package. The main objective of the *ActiveCA* package is to identify the most
appropriate impedance functions for active transportation modes for
various destinations and time periods in Canada. To do achieve this objective, we analyzed historical data from the [General Social Survey
(GSS)](https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&SDDS=5221)
from 1986 to 2015 in Canada to calculate the impedance function for
cycling and walking trips.

In this R markdown, we read the main files of GSS surveys and prepare the data set to
the following analyses.

# The General Social Surveys (GSS)

In Canada, Statistics Canada produces the General Social Surveys (GSS)
to collect data on social trends in order to track changes in the living
conditions of Canadians and well-being over time. This survey tracks
changes in time and it is used to understand how Canadians spend and
manage their time and what factors contribute to their happiness and
stress. The survey was created in 1985 as a series of independent,
annual, cross-sectional surveys, each covering one topic in depth.
Caregiving, families, time use, social identity, volunteering, and
victimization are among the current themes of the GSS.

The six survey themes listed above are repeated every five years. In
addition to the central topic, each cycle includes new content that
addresses emerging and policy-relevant issues, collecting detailed
socio-demographic information, such as age, gender, education, religion,
ethnicity, income, etc. Time-use surveys collect data on all human
activities and can inform a wide range of policies. In particular, three
key themes have been identified as essential for policymaking and for
which no other data source is adequate: unpaid work and non-market
production, well-being, and gender equality. Leisure time, work-life
balance, health, commuting, culture, and sports are among the other
topics covered by time-use surveys. In addition, statistics Canada has
been conducting time-use surveys at five to seven year intervals since
1986, with the most recent being in 2015 (1986, 1992, 1998, 2005, 2010,
and 2015). The time use collects information on participation of
respondents and time spent on a wide range of day-to-day activities
using a 24-hour retrospective diary. Also, information is collected on
the location of these activities (e.g., at home, at work, etc.) and, for
non-personal activities, the people who were present with the respondent
at the time of the activity.

The surveys (obtained from
[here](http://odesi2.scholarsportal.info/webview/)) consist of two
files: a main file and an episode file.

## The Main File

The Main File compiles an large array of aggregated data, summarizing
the answers to the questionnaire and derived variables that summarize
the respondents' time use across different activities, locations, and
social interactions. This file documents the time and duration that
respondents allocate to each activity and location. The Main File
provides a overview of daily routines and social dynamics, not focusing
on individual activity episodes. Additionally, this file categorizes
activities into bigger groups and subcategories, enhancing the data's
analytical utility with additional metrics such as total transit time,
duration spent with household members, and counts of activities and
episodes. This file is aggregated and prohibits the direct association
between specific activities with particular locations or companions.

# Reading and processing the GSS files

In this R markdown, our aim is to generate a table in the appropriate
format to perform the subsequent analyses, after reading and processing
the GSS main surveys.

To start processing the data, first load the `R` packages used in this
notebook:

```{r read-libraries}
library(dplyr) # A Grammar of Data Manipulation
library(ggplot2) # Create Elegant Data Visualisations Using the Grammar of Graphics
library(here) # A Simpler Way to Find Your Files
library(readxl) # Read Excel Files
library(tidyr) # Tidy Messy Data
library(usethis) # Automate Package and Project Setup
library(purrr) # Provides a complete and consistent set of tools for working with functions and vectors
```

For each survey year, the process of preparing the data is very similar
and, in the end, we will obtain a table in which each row represents an
specific respondent, and each column a variable. Since every survey introduced different variables, 
we will not try to align the name columns and values between the tables. 

The file name pattern is as follows: `gss_main_` +
`year of survey` [^4]. This means that, for instance, the file
`gss_main_20105` refers to the main file of the 2005 GSS survey.

## GSS 2015

Read the Main file of the 2015 GSS survey:

```{r reading-2015-main-file}
# Main File
gss_m_2015 <- read.csv(paste0(here(), "/data-raw/source-files/Time-use-2015/gss-m.csv"))
```

Select only the socioeconomic variables: 

```{r filtering-variables-2015}
gss_main_2015 <- gss_m_2015 %>%
  select(PUMFID:DVTDAY)
```

Labeling socioeconomic variables: 

```{r SURVMNTH-2015}

  mutate( # SURVMNTH: Survey month of data collection from April 2015 to March 2016

## GSS 1986

Read the Main files of the 1986 GSS survey:

```{r reading-1986-main-file}
# Main File
gss_m_1986 <- read.csv(paste0(here(), "/data-raw/source-files/Time-use-1986/gss-12M0002-E-1986-c-2-main_F1.csv"))
```

Select only the socioeconomic variables: 

```{r filtering-variables-1986}
gss_main_1986 <- gss_m_1986 %>%
  select(c("SEQNUM", 
 "FWGT_OS", 
 "DVAGEGR", 
 "DVSEX", 
 "DVMARST",
 "DVHHLDSZ",
 "PROV", 
 "DVCHILD"))
```
