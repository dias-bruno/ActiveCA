# ActiveCA

{ActiveCA} is an open data product in the form of an R data package,
developed after the collection, cleaning, and processing of [General
Social Survey
(GSS)](https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&SDDS=5221)
data ranging from 1986 to 2015. The main objective of the {ActiveCA}
package is to identify the most appropriate impedance functions for
active transportation modes for various destinations and time periods in
Canada. The package also provides analysis-ready data on active
transportation episodes, focusing on walking and cycling activities,
with information on trip origins, destinations, and duration.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ActiveCA from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("dias-bruno/ActiveCA")
```
