This repository was created with the main objective of contributing to the open-source data project ActiveCA (https://github.com/dias-bruno/ActiveCA). Specifically, the purpose of the Jupyter Notebook within this folder is to enable users to download the .rda files using a Python script and work with them through algorithms developed in Python. The script reads these files as dataframes, which can be easily manipulated using libraries such as Pandas.
